		      				        <h2>Challenges</h2>
		      					         <p>The challenge was getting javascript to work in conjunction with the HTML webpage code,
															 and properly exporting it onto the final webpage. There also was an aspect to altering the CSS
														 	 with the javascript code.</p>
		             </div>
		                <div id="content-problems">
		      				        <h2>Problems</h2>
		      					         <p>There were a few problems with syntax and the usual issues with fogetting certain elements
															  like semicolons or capitalization. However with this lab, both me and my partner had an
																exxcedingly difficult tim e trying to figure out what the Node problems were.
																Trying different variations in the lecture, slides, and the lab description. We turned to
																outside sources and found textnodes were a bit simpler to use in javascript for the purpose
																of this lab.</p>

		      				        <h2>Results</h2>
		      					         <p>I got it working, but it does use a different command/function than the one described in the lab description.
														 If you want to see the final output of my javascript, just look at the top of the page. (the elements changed in its CSS are the colors of the text)</p>
