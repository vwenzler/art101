		<h1>Lab 4: Pseaudocoding</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>We had difficulty writing Pseudocode and getting the correct vernacular
				for the writing. There was some difficulty with writing the Java file
				header because we were unsure about the formatting and how it is meant to work.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Some of the Problems we ran into were trying to adjust some of the CSS formatting for the results section.
				Such as not having content divisions in the correct places. Another Problem was adjusting the borders around the lists. There is another border around the the nested unordered list.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>We created a page for Lab 4 that goes over the process for creating pseudocode.
				Pseudocode was created for a few functions like a real life task, and a compuiter based task.
				The Computer based task was written into a Java file as comments</p>

									//check if user number is different from computer number
										//check which number computer has
