  		      			  <h2>Problems</h2>
  		      					 <p>We ran into some issues with getting the function to
                         print to the HTML page. Notably the function was not
                         fully working. After struggling with the function for
                         hours, we realized that there was a probhlem with what
                         the input element corresponded to in the function.
                         After figuring this out, adding a single line that made
                         it directly link up to the next part of the function
                         fixed the problem. </p>
