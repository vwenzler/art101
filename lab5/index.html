				<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
				<h2>Challenges</h1>
					<p>One challenge was writing in the Java Console because I didn't know how to delete problems or remove incorrect lines.
						This led to me restarting several times before arriving at what is was supposed to look like.</p>
				<h2>Problems</h1>
					<p>One issue we ran into was uploading the image and connecting it into the html file.
					Specifically by linking the incorrect folder or giving the wrong location.
					Which was fixed after a few minutes, otherwise no problems came up. </p>
				<h2>Results</h1>
					<p>Created a javascript that could run when linked to the html file, and here it is:</p>
				<div>
						<h2>Script Output</h2>
						<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
				</div>
			</div>
			<a href="js/lab.js" target="source">Link to My JavaScript</a>
