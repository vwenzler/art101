		<p>	My name is Vincent Wenzler. I am an artist and have worked with many diferent physical mediums such as clays, paints, and paper
			 as well as various experience with digital tools like photoshop, illustrate, and Maya.
			 This website is my first foray into coding for art or just in general.
			  Beyond creating art I also like to build model kits, listen to synthwave and play videogames. I hope my coding and website continues to grow and get better in the future.<p>
